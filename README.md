# AquaMan

_Your aquarium-helper!_

## What is AquaMan?

**It has nothing to do with the movie**, but it helps you manage your aquarium, by keeping track of feedings, fishes
and more.

- [ ] Manage Water-changes

## What it won't offer

AquaMan won't support any authentication at all because I am tired of caring about authentication.
You could run AquaMan behind [SimpleSelfhostAuth](https://github.com/mawoka-myblock/SimpleSelfhostAuth), so it is
secure.
